            </h1>
            <p class="center-text mega-margin">Finding stocks in play is safe strategy to avoid being completely manipulated by algorithmic trading. Stocks in play can be found either by knowing what other day traders are trading, by looking for news or earnings reports or calls, or by technical analysis via scanners. This reviews scanner scripts I have found for think or swim, not as a serious decision to choose one over another, but as a general inquiry into what a machine learning algorithm would need as inputs to perform day trading at at-least upper-amateur levels.</p>

            <p class="center-text mega-margin">Deep learning often pushes Bayesian methods aside, but how can we bring them together to measure a model conficence? Is it simpler to measure a model's confidence after-the-fact, or can we build-into or extract this information from the model itself? How well does a simpler I-dont-know approach compare?</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="center-text mega-margin">Several Implementations of the Hurst Coefficient initially contracticted eachother in output. I wanted to see how they compared, and try to understand why some fail. Also, I am interested in the change of coefficient as timescale is reduced and time series are subsequently broken down in to smaller chunks. An interesting take would be to perform candlestick summarizations and compute hurst coefficients over the summaries to see how the coefficient evolves as summarizations are performed.</p>
