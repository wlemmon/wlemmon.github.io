            </h1>
            <p class="center-text mega-margin">Several Implementations of the Hurst Coefficient initially contracticted eachother in output. I wanted to see how they compared, and try to understand why some fail. Also, I am interested in the change of coefficient as timescale is reduced and time series are subsequently broken down in to smaller chunks. An interesting take would be to perform candlestick summarizations and compute hurst coefficients over the summaries to see how the coefficient evolves as summarizations are performed.</p>

            <p class="center-text mega-margin">Taught by Ashok Goel and David Joyner, this repo houses my work from class. My implementation was in the top 3 for solving Ravin's Matrices on a held-out test set, and we published the results were published in ICCC (June 2015, pp. 23-30). The repo is private to discourage plagairism.</p>

            <p class="center-text mega-margin">FunnelSort is a cache-oblivious sorting algorithm. The main idea is to access memory contiguously by laying out accesses recursively in a fractal pattern. A recursive k-funnel is very similar in concept to a space filling curve.</p>
